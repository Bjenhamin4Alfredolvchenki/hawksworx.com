## Don't get excited. This isn't access to a real beta

The buttons below are just to help demonstrate a clever little trick you can do with Netlify's Split Test feature.


## In or out?

Clicking this button will add a cookie which will result in Netlify's intelligent CDN routing your requests to hawksworx.com to a version where I'm experimenting with a brave new colour scheme. All the orange you can eat!

<a href="#" id="btn-opt-in" class="btn">Gimme access to the beta pleeeeease!</a>


Ok, you tires the orange theme and hated it. That's ok. That's why we test. The button below will opt you out of the "beta" version of the site and keep things bright, lime, fluorescent, lively green.

<a href="#" id="btn-opt-out" class="btn">Green me! This orange version is horrible.</a>
