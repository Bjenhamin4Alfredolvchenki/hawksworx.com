## Don't get excited. This isn't access to a real beta

The button below is just to help demonstrate a clever little trick you can do with Netlify's Split Test feature.

Clicking this button will add a cookie which will result in Netlify's intelligent CDN invisibly routing your requests to hawksworx.com to the master branch. No more orange colour scheme for you!
